        <h2>Hi, I'm Sunaina!</h2>
        <p>I am a Masters in Computer Science student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Before joining my Masters program I worked as a Fullstack Software Engineer and am most interested in working on products that prioritize their customers' interests.</p>
        <p> Some technologies I am experienced in and passionate about include Golang, Python, and GraphQL. Please reach out to me to learn more about my experience and if you would like to work with me!</p>
